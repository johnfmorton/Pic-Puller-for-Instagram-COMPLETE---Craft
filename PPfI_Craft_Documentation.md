# Documentation

## Overview

Pic Puller for Craft, a.k.a. PPfC, helps you set up your _own_ application with Instagram. That application will exist within your Craft CMS installation. Pic Puller walks you through the steps of creating the application, authorizing your Craft users via oAuth, and provides Craft tags for you to access the data that comes in from Instagram.

### Version History

* Version 1.2.1
	* Fixed issue where if you customized the Plugin name to be an empty string it was not defaulting back to the original plugin name.
* Version 1.2
	* Updated for consistent lanugage in app
* Version 1.1
	* Private beta release of PPfC

### How to install Pic Puller for Craft

Copy the "picpuller" directory that sits alongside this file to your Craft site in the plugins directory. The path to that direction should be "craft/plugins/".

Log into your control panel of Craft and visit the Settings page. From here, select "Plugins". You should see "Pic Puller" listed among your plugins. You will need to click the "Install" button to the right of the line. Once installed, Pic Puller's status should be "Enabled" automatically.

Once PPfC is installed, you will see it added to the top-level navigation in your control panel. Select "Pic Puller" from the top-level navigation.

### Setting up your own Instagram application

You should now see the PPfC control panel with 3 sections: Set Up, Active App Info & Authorized Users.

In the Set Up section, follow the onscreen instructions to set up your Instagram application.

The basic workflow will take you to Instagram to set up an application. PPfC provides you with an oAuth url that Instagram will ask for. Once the application is created within the Instagram developer area, you will take the Client ID and Client Secret put them into the PPfC Set Up screen and save them.

You can then authorize your new Instagram application to access your Instagram media.

### Other users and Pic Puller for Craft

You are not limited to only one user with PPfC. If you have the "Users" package activated in Craft, other users can also authorize their accounts as well.

Any "Admin" level user will be able to alter and delete the Pic Puller application.

Users that have not been granted "Admin" rights, can still access Pic Puller as long as you have granted them access under the "Users" tab. This can be done on a one-by-one basis under the "Users" tab, or on a more global scale if you set up User Groups and provide the group access to Pic Puller. These non-admin users will only have the ability to authorize and unauthorize your app. They will not be able to change or delete the app.

### Media by tag

#### craft.picpuller.tagged_media

Description:
Get a list of recently tagged media. Note that this media is ordered by when the media was tagged with this tag, rather than the order it was posted.

For consistency amongst the tags used in Pic Puller, the Craft tags use ‘next_max_id’ for pagination. If you refer to the Instagram documentation, you will see references ‘max_tag_id’ is used for pagination. That does not apply to Pic Puller. Those tags are rewritten by the module to be ‘next_max_id’.
