    <h2 class='pp ppwarning'>Delete Application Confirmation</h2>

    <p>You are about to delete the current Instagram application from Craft. This will also delete all user oAuth information from the database. If you create a new application or re-create the one you are about to delete, all users will be required to reauthorize the application.</p>

    <p>This process does not delete the app from within the Instagram development area. You must do that from the <a href="http://instagram.com/developer/clients/manage/" target='_blank'>Manage Clients</a> page on Instagram.</p>
